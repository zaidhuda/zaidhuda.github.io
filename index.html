  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I'm a lead software engineer with a long-standing interest in building products and trying new tech. I've shipped and maintained apps across the stack and enjoy mentoring and setting technical direction.</p>

  <h2>What I do</h2>

  <h3>Engineering</h3>
  <p>I focus on clear architecture, maintainable code, and helping teams ship. I still like to get my hands dirty with new languages and tools, and I care about the craft as much as the outcome.</p>

  <h3>Side projects</h3>
  <p>I keep a few personal projects going—small web tools and the like—when time allows. You can find them on the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page.</p>

  <h2>Elsewhere</h2>
  <p>For work and collaboration, the best places to reach me are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaid-huda">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zaidhuda">GitHub</a>. For a full list of links, see <a href="/contact">Contact</a>.</p>
